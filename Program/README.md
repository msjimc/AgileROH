# Downloading binaries

It is possible to download the whole of this GitHub repository by selecting the green 'Code' button (Figure 1) and either selecting the 'Download ZIP' option or by copying the "https://github.com/msjimc/AgileROH.git" link and using a download manager such as wget on Linux. This will download the whole repository with the programs in the Programs > Windows or Programs > Linux folders. While this will also contain the user guide files, they will not display very well as they are in a mark up language.
