## Data file format

### VCF text files with .vcf extension 
VCF files have a complex structure with the start consisting of a number of lines starting with '##' that describe the data format in the rest of the file. This is followed by a single line starting with '#' that describes the fields/columns in the rest of the file as outlined in the table below. The contents of the __FORMAT__ and __Sample__ columns are variable with the requirements of ```AgileROHFinder``` and ```AgileROHFilterer``` outlined in the 2nd table.


|Header|Description|Possible values|Note|Required|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|#CHROM|Chromosome|The name of the reference sequence in the genome. For autosomal chromosomes it is a number (1-22). X, Y and MT typically refere to the mitrochondrial and sex chromosomes. Other sequences may be present that contain unlocated sequences, common viruses or common alternative haplotypes these tend to have complex names. <br /><br />These names may have the 'chr' prefix.|Only values of 1 to 22 or chr1 to chr22 are retained|Yes|
|POS|Position|The variant's location in the reference sequence (The first base of the reference may be referenced as 0 and not 1).|Any whole number|Yes|
|ID|Variant name| This can be any text value, but is typically either a RS id or a '.'|AgileROH may filter variants based on the presence of 'RS' at the start of the name|Optional|
|REF|Variant's wild type allele|Any possible sequence of A, C, G and T|Only alleles of one nucleotide are retained|Yes|
|ALT|Variant's alternative allele(s)|Any possible sequence of A, C, G and T. If a variant is heterozygous for two none reference alleles each allele will be separated by a comma.|Only variants with a single, 1 base allele are retained |Yes|
|QUAL|Quality score|Any number or '.'|An aligner/variant caller specific score of the variant's quality|No|
|FILTER|Variant filtering describing any filtering performed on the data|Any value|Not used|No|
|INFO|Variant specific data created by variant caller|List of key value pairs||No|
|FORMAT|Structure and format of variant specific data, written as a series of keys (described in the header section) separated by colon (__:__)|The contents are variable depending on variant caller and variant type|See below|Yes| 
|\<JT706\> (Sample/patient name)|Alphanumeric text|Variant specific data as described in the __FORMAT__ column|See below|Yes|

The contents of the __Format__ and __Sample__ columns are variable, being variant caller and variant type specific. For example a VCF file created by GATK's 'haplotypecaller' may have a format field like this ' GT:AD:DP:GQ:PL', table below discribes its structure.

|Key|Value|Description|Required|
|-|-|-|-|
|GT|Variant's genotype|Each allele is numbered with the reference allele = 0 and the alternative allele's value given by its position in the Alt column list of alleles. The programs ignores variants with multiple alternative alleles so this value is always 1. Homozygous variants are shown as 1/1, while heterozygous positions or 0/1 (homozygous reference genotypes (0/0) are typically not present)|No| 
|AD|Two numbers separated by a ','|Allelic depths for the ref and alt alleles in the order listed|Yes|
|DP|Number|Approximate read depth (poor quality reads may be ignored)|No|
|GQ|Number|Genotype Quality as calculated by the variant caller|No|
|PL|Three numbers separated by ','|Normalized, Phred-scaled likelihoods for genotypes as defined in the VCF specification|No|

As can be seen from the two tables the programs require the chromosome, position and allele data that is always present in a vcf file. However, they also requires the allele read depth and total read depth data points as detailed in columns 9 and 10 of the file,; this may be omitted by some variant callers. Consequently it is suggested that GATK's haplotypecaller is used to make the files.
